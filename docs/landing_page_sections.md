### Why It Beats Legacy Methods (Compressed Table):

| | **Hyve** | **Pressure Taps** | **CFD Simulation** | **Pressure Paint** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Real-time data** | ✓ Sub-second | ✗ Delayed | ✗ Hours/days | ✗ Post-processing |
| **Surface coverage** | ✓ Full area | ✗ Sparse points | ✓ Complete | ⚠ Limited |
| **Reusable** | ✓ Infinite | ⚠ Invasive | ✓ Simulations | ✗ Single-use |
| **Deployment time** | ✓ <1 hour | ✗ Days | N/A | ✗ Hours setup |
| **Non-invasive** | ✓ Peel & stick | ✗ Drilled holes | ✓ Virtual | ⚠ Paint residue |
| **Multi-parameter** | ✓ P+T+Strain | ✗ Pressure only | ✓ All | ✗ Pressure only |

**Bottom line:** Hyve is the only technology that combines full-surface coverage, real-time feedback, non-invasive deployment, and multi-parameter sensing in both controlled and real-world environments.

## CRITICAL: WHAT NOT TO DO

**Don't:**
- Lead with "About Us" or company history
- Use generic stock photos of engineers or wind tunnels
- Bury the cost savings in paragraph text
- Make the CTA "Contact Us" or "Learn More" (too vague)
- Show sensor technology without showing the DATA it produces
- Claim "aerospace-grade" without showing certifications
- Have more than 2 CTAs per section (decision paralysis)

**Do:**
- Lead with customer outcomes (savings, time, data density)
- Use actual product photos and real data visualizations
- Make savings the hero stat with prominent placement
- Segment CTAs by audience (F1 teams / Aerospace OEMs / Researchers)
- Show pressure maps, not just sensor arrays
- Display certification logos/numbers prominently
- Have primary CTA (high contrast) and secondary (outline) only
