Design Architecture: One Core Product, Three Deployment Modes

The governing design principle (non-negotiable)

One sensing platform. Multiple deployment states. Increasing operational permanence.

Visually, the site should communicate:

same skin
same data logic
different environments
different time horizons
Homepage master structure (this is the backbone)

1. Hero: one product, many realities

Design choice

Single hero image with environmental transitions, not multiple heroes.
Concept:

Same surface section (wing / blade / panel)
Background changes as you scroll or fade:
Wind tunnel
Track / flight / road
Industrial field (mine, turbine, structure)

Design rules

Product stays constant
Context changes
Data overlay stays consistent
This visually solves:

“Is this a research tool or an operational system?”
Answer: Yes. By design.

2. Deployment modes section (core design innovation)

This is the most important structural change.

Create a section called (placeholder):

Deployment Modes

Layout

Three equal cards or columns — not vertical scrolling (this matters psychologically).

Each card:

Real photography background
Identical UI/data overlay treatment
Different permanence & use case cues
Mode 1: Experimental Testing

Visual cues

Wind tunnel
Test rig
Temporary installation
High-density instrumentation
 

 

 

Design language:

grids
reference markers
calibration cues
Mode 2: Real-world Aero / Moto Testing

Visual cues

Race car / aircraft in motion
On-track / on-wing installation
Portable deployment kit aesthetic
 

 

Design language:

motion blur (subtle)
telemetry feel
ruggedised hardware cues
Mode 3: Continuous Industrial Monitoring

Visual cues

Wind turbines
Mining equipment
Large industrial assets
 

 

 

Design language:

long timelines
environmental exposure
persistence & durability
3. Visual “time axis” (this is how you avoid dilution)

Immediately after deployment modes, introduce a horizontal timeline graphic:

Hours / Days → Weeks → Years

Mapped to:

Testing
Validation
Monitoring
Design effect:

Reassures aerospace buyers
Signals industrial scalability
Frames monitoring as earned, not speculative
4. Application sectors: secondary, not primary

Critical design rule

Do not lead with industries.
Lead with deployment logic, then show industries underneath.

Design approach:

Small, elegant icon row under each mode:
Aerospace
Motorsport
Wind
Mining
Infrastructure
This prevents:

“What are you actually selling?” confusion
Investor “boil the ocean” anxiety
5. Data consistency as visual glue

Across all modes:

Same color palette for data
Same visual grammar
Same measurement metaphors
Only change:

density
update frequency
permanence
This quietly communicates:

“Our platform scales without reinventing itself.”

6. Navigation redesign (simple but powerful)

Top-level nav should reflect how buyers think, not industries.

Suggested structure

Technology
Deployment
Data Platform
Research Heritage
Collaborate
Avoid:

“Solutions”
“Markets”
“Industries” at top level (can live one level down)
7. Footer: institutional gravity

Add:

Research lineage (Cranfield)
Government / defence / aerospace alignment
Standards & compliance placeholders (even if coming)
This supports:

mining & industrial buyers
long procurement cycles
Big-picture design takeaway

What you’re building visually is this belief:

Hyve is how sensing moves from experiment → reality → infrastructure.

If the site gets this right:

Wind tunnels feel like the obvious starting point
Aero/moto feels like the proof
Industrial monitoring feels inevitable
